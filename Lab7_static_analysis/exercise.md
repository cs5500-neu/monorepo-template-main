# Cppcheck

Edit the following lines below to list two things you learned about your code by using cppcheck. If your code was 100% perfect, than write two things you learned about the tool cppcheck (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" exercise, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced and were able to apply cppcheck. Note: It is recommended you resolve any of the errors you find from cppcheck, but we will not check your assignment 3 otherwise to see that you made these fixes.
