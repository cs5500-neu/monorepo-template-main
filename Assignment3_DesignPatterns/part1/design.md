# Design

Before developing software, it's important to design first. To sit and think about what data structres will you use, how you think the pattern will work, and even to sketch it out.

Please fill out your design notes below. Include the following:
- What data structure you think you will use?
- What happens if you undo several times, redo, then make a changes to pixels, and then try to redo?
- What happens if the user does the same command twice in a row? Should it be recorded?
- Any other thoughts you have.
- We will grade this based off of completion, and a quick check to see that you sketched out some reasonable idea before jumping into the code.


*for you to fill out in this space some of your design notes*
