## The Monorepo

Welcome! This repository will be how to retrieve homework assignments and in-class lab assignments for this course,

Okay, let's get started!

### Learning git
If you are not familiar with git, you can quickly learn the basics of how it works in about 15 minutes.

* An interactive tutorial:

### Github and this course

This course utilizes github because:

- It is good real world skill to have.
- Github is the website which provides a service to store our files, and 'git' is the version control system.
- It is easy for me to monitor your progress and receive your assignments for grading.
  - (You will also never e-mail me code snippets, I can just look!)
- In order to receive your assignments, you simply do 'git pull' after I have released them.
  - This will make sense after trying the tutorial if you are new to git.

That being said, I can only grade what you have **pushed** to your repo by the due date. Make sure to push your latest changes to your repo. The timestamp tells me when your file was submitted as well.

## Monorepo

A monorepo is known as a 'monolithic' repository. Companies like Google for instance have nearly all of their code from every single employee in one single repository. Some companies choose to have many separate repositories. Which strategy would you think is better? Take a moment to think about it, and you can read more on the 'why' (at least for Google) and other companies below:

## FAQ

- Q: How do I ask for help using this repository?
  - A: On piazza you can link to your repository, or otherwise let us know your github name (another reason to edit this [readme](./README.md) with your name) so we can find your code quickly.
- Q: May I upload the github to a public repository for prospective employers to see?
  - A: **No. You may not upload any assignments or labs.** 
  - This is for your protection in case assignments or parts of assignments are reused. 
  - You *may* list the project on your resume/CV if you like, and provide the code upon request to the employer. 
  - You could additionally provide a webpage describing the project, showing screenshots, and discussing high-level ideas of how you solved the project.
- Q: May I upload 'gists', pastebins, or other snippets of code to external websites(like stackoverflow) to share when I ask questions.
  - A: **No** You may not upload any part of an assignment to the world wide web or other shared storage where other students or prospective students would see the assignments. You and any students who copy your work are violating academic integrity policies of this course, and can get in trouble.
- Q: May I upload my final project to a public repository after the semester is over? (Applicable only to my courses with final projects)
  - A: **Yes under the following conditions**
    - The course actually has a final project, which is a unique idea (i.e. not assignment or series of assignments) that you or a team developed from scratch.
    - You acknowledge your team members for their contributions.
    - You remove the README.md provided with the final project from the course (delete it entirely from your github history), as you'll want your own readme anyway.
    
## (Northeastern University Students) Obtaining a Khoury account

### Logistics (Ignore for Computer Graphics or Building Game Engines courses)

For all assignments, you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete the assignments. The reason is because the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is where your submission will be graded. While it is true you can probably do much of the assignments locally (if you have a Mac, Windows Terminal, or Linux machine), you **must** make sure your submissions work on the Khoury servers.

**Another** important feature of working on the servers is that they are periodically backed up. That is, you can `cd .snapshot` and recover work captured in various intervals if you did not happen to push it to github in time.

### Accounts

Note that all assignments and labs are tested and graded on the Khoury web servers: `ssh your_user_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` (i.e. running an assignment on your Mac, is NOT the same environment as our Khoury servers which run a linux system).
