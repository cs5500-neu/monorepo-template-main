# Tokens

Late assignment submissions receive a maximum of 25%...**but there is a way to save yourself**!

1. Either submit your assignments on time (90%+ of folks do just fine)
2. Use 1 or more of your tokens! (Read below to see how it works).

## Extensions/Late Day/Tokens System

In this course you get '3' tokens to extend an assignment or lab by 1 day.

- You use a token by moving the token to the root directory of the assignment or lab.
	- e.g. (i.e. `git mv token1 ./destination ; git commit -m "Moved token1"; git push`)
- You can use as many tokens as you have on an assignment.
	- e.g. Move token1, token2, and token3 into an assignment directory to extend the assignment 3 days.
- You **should not** e-mail me or anyone else to use the token--just move the token into the assignment or lab directory.
	- The only reason I should be e-mailed otherwise to ask for an extension is if you have otherwise used all 3 of your tokens and there is some life circumstance the requires us discussing whether you have enough time to put into the course to complete it successfully. 

### Some rules on the tokens

- Tokens may not be applied to final projects.
- Tokens may not be copied or borrowed from friends.
- Do not ask for more tokens--the token release schedule is 3 per semester. :)
	- (You cannot split tokens into fractions either. Nice try!) 
- In the instance that I extend an assignment deadline and you had already used your token, just move your token back to the root directory and save it for another time.
- Do not 'git rm' (or otherwise delete) your token. Only use 'git mv' so we can keep track of if you used it or not. 
- Tokens cannot be applied by going 'back in time' several days/weeks. 
	- If you forget to move  a token into the directory by the time we grade the assignment, it is too late. 
		- If you ever have concerns, look inside your repository on github.com and that is what we will see.
		- E-mails to me asking about or telling stories about how you forgot to move the token are unfortunate, but we have to play by the rules (you will still have your tokens to use in the future).
			- Again, going back in time several days or weeks to remove a late penalty is gaming the system...
- The tokens system was dveloped to be fair to all students and our course staff. 
	- In the past I have tried to be flexible with extensions, but unfortunately that system gets taken advantage of. 
	- I have also found students who tend to need to use more than 3 extensions may be better off taking the course another semester. Life happens and that is okay, we should probably have a discussion about how you can be successful once all of your tokens are gone.
	- My past policy was 1 day late is 10% off of an assignment or lab--this token system benefits students from a grading perspective and is an experiment.
		- Please do not abuse the token system--unfortunately if it becomes more work to manage it will go away.
		- e.g. If I find folks trying to reuse tokens, that is called 'cheating' and will be dealt with on a 1:1 basis.
	- The token system was thus devleoped to:
		- a.) Ease the management of keeping track of extensions for students.
		- b.) Reduce the amount of e-mails, guilt, and decision making on my end. Honestly, sometimes you just need an extra day here or there, and I do not believe I should be in charge anymore of making or confirming that decision.


### Example breakdown

Without using your tokens.

- Late 1 day = 90% max
- Late 2 day = 80% max
- Late 3 day = 70% max
- Late 4 day = 60% max
- Late 5 day = 50% max
- Late 6 day = 40% max
- Late 7 day = 30% max
- Late 8 day = 25% max
- Late 9 day = 25% max
- Late 10 day = At this point we are not grading your assignment, 0%

If you use your tokens:

- Late 1 day = 100% max (If you use 1 token)
- Late 2 day = 100% max (If you use 2 tokens)
- Late 3 day = 100% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 4 day = 90% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 5 day = 80% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 6 day = 70% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 7 day = 60% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 8 day = 50% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 9 day = 40% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 10 day = 30% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 11 day = 25% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 12 day = 25% max (If you use 3 tokens)
- Late 13 day = At this point we are not grading your assignment, 0%
